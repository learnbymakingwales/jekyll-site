The Dysgu trwy greu digital lab will introduce participants to concepts, methodologies and ideas used in digital delivery.

[We](/en/team) plan to share resources and artefacts as we go and will publish them here so that anyone can use them.

We have created a [reading list](/en/reading-list) where we link to all the great content we refer to in the lab sessions. 

### Content

* [Tips for writing weeknotes](/en/resource/tips-for-writing-weeknotes.html)
* [Data-driven content design tips](/en/resource/content-design-tips.html)
* [Content request forms and how to use them](/en/resource/content-request-forms.html)

### Manual of me

Inspired by Emily Webber's [team manual](https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/) and using Cassie Robinson's [template](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) we've created our own version of the 'manual of me'.

### Project site

[Project site template repository](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/project-site-template)

You can use this to quickly spin up project sites that are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
There is some [documentation](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/project-site-template/tree/main/_docs) to help you get started with common tasks.

We have written a couple of guides to help people starting out with Git and Markdown.
