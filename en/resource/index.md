The Dysgu trwy greu digital lab will introduce participants to concepts, methodologies and ideas used in digital delivery.

We plan to share resources and artefacts as we go and will publish them here so that anyone can use them.

We have created a [reading list](/en/reading-list) where we link to all the great content we refer to in the lab sessions. 

## Templates

### Manual of me

Inspired by Emily Webber's [team manual](https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/) and using Cassie Robinson's [template](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) we've created our own version of the 'manual of me'.

### Project site

[Project site template repository](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/project-site-template)

You can use this to quickly spin up project sites that are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
There is some [documentation](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/project-site-template/tree/main/_docs) to help you get started with common tasks.
