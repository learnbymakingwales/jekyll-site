The Dysgu trwy greu digital lab will introduce participants to concepts, methodologies and ideas used in digital delivery.

We plan to share resources and artefacts as we go and will publish them here so that anyone can use them.

## Templates

### Manual of me

Inspired by Emily Webber's [team manual](https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/) and using Cassie Robinson's [template](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) we've created our own version of the 'manual of me'.
