# Tips for writing weeknotes

It’s worth starting with saying the best weeknotes are the ones that get written! If you apply too much structure and rules to them then they’ll become a chore, and ultimately won’t get written at all.

Here are some tips that you may find helpful.

## Write for yourself in the first instance

Weeknotes act as a great reminder for what you’ve achieved over the course of a project. If you treat weeknotes as something that you can refer back to then you’ll find them useful and we guarantee that others will too!

## Take it in turns and don’t worry about structure

Different types of writing might require you to follow a particular tone of voice or style, but weeknotes are often more interesting when they reflect the personality of the person who’s writing them. 

## Try to focus on what you’ve done rather than what you plan to do

Writing about what you’ve achieved or learned, rather than what you plan to do is often a lot easier. You can also avoid inadvertently setting the wrong expectations if you talk about “next steps” rather than “by next week”.

## Some weeks are quieter than others

Sometimes you’ll have loads you’ll want to write about, and other weeks less so. That’s fine. Some weeks loads of things will happen, you’ll have a ton of stuff to point to, and other weeks will be a bit slower.

## Even the briefest of weeknotes are helpful

Sometimes you run out of time and it’s easy to skip a week of writing. But even if it’s super brief, putting something online helps keep the momentum going. Here’s an example of that from the folks at [Berg](http://berglondon.com/blog/2013/09/24/week-432/).
