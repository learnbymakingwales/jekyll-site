# What is Git?

**Git** helps users keep track of work done on a project.

The jargon term most commonly used is version control.

Traditionally we save multiple copies of a file, but Git makes you save snapshots of files. 
In Git these snapshots are called commits.

Git stores the whole history of your project and records what has changed and who changed it.

Git makes it easy to jump between snapshots. That makes it easy to fix mistakes or test different versions.
