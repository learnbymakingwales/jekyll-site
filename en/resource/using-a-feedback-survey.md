# Using a feedback survey

## What is a survey and what are the benefits?

* a feedback survey is used for identifying or measuring the experience of users
* it helps uncover insights into products or services
* with a good survey design, you are more likely to receive higher response rates, completion rates, and therefore, more accurate data

## Why use a survey?

* you can keep it running for an indefinite amount of time
* this will give residents an opportunity to provide their feedback on your website when it suits them
* you can look at responses over a stretch of time, spot trends and identify the most frustrating things for your users
* identifying key issues means your can direct your website improvement on areas that will have the most impact
* it gives users a chance to opt-in to research if you have the capacity to engage with them in the future

## Best practice

* keep the survey short, concise and use plain language
* make it visible for site visitors (in accessible colours so those with visual impairments can use it too)
* for government websites the design patterns position the feedback banners at the top of the page

## Visual examples from GOV.UK

Here are some examples of how the feedback call to action looks on a variety of government websites.

## A template survey

As a part of the project funded by the Welsh Local Government Association we produced an [example template for capturing feedback about the council tax service](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/discussion-guide-template.pdf).

### Tips for using the template on your service

* though the survey refers to ‘Council Tax’ this can be swapped out for any of your services to get feedback on those areas
* if you do change the service area, remember to change the options under question 3 so that it aligns
* you can also remove references to a service entirely, make it more generic and use it across your website end-to-end
* you will need somebody with web development skills to get the survey onto your website
* you may find ["get feedback"](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-feedback-page) guidance in the gov.uk service manual useful
