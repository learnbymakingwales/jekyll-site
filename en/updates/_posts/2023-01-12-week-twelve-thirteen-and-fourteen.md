### 12 January 2023

Happy New Year everyone!

We hope you had a lovely Christmas and New Year - hopefully with some good downtime.

After the mad rush in November and December the learnbymaking labs team all had a well earned rest so there haven’t been too many working days since our last update. Hence calling this weeknote “Week twelve, thirteen and fourteen.”

The main update is the team and folks at [CDPS](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/) are trying to find participants to do the second labs with. [We learnt a lot doing the pilot](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/updates/2022/12/21/what-weve-learned.html) but there is still [plenty we need to figure out](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/roadmap/), so it is important we pick the right set of participants who will help us answer some of our unanswered questions. 

And a few of the [pilot team](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/team/) have moved on to other projects whilst this is figured out.

## Updating resources

We have continued to update the site and the tools we created for the pilot.

We have fixed and finished off some long standing niggles - such as making the post dates bilingual in the [project site template](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/project-site-template). 

We have moved some of the changes we made in the NRW prototype kit to the [learnbymaking one](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/lbm-prototype-kit) so that they are available to the next set of participants (and anyone else who uses it).

And we have published [a guide explaining how to get started with Service blueprints](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/how-to-use-service-blueprints.html). If anyone has any feedback on it, please get in touch (details are at the end of this).

## Publishing more in Welsh

[Learnbymaking.wales](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/) is for Wales, which means we are committed to providing our content and resources in both English and Welsh so that everyone across the Welsh public sector can benefit from them.

We have done a pretty good job so far but the pace we had to work at meant we made the decision to publish some of our guides and reusable templates in English first whilst we worked on the Welsh versions.

Thanks to a gargantuan effort from Alaw, we are well on the way to fixing this. More of the site is bilingual and we have published Welsh versions of the [Manual of me template](https://learnbymaking.wales/cy/resource/manual-of-me-welsh.png) and the [Service blueprint template](https://learnbymaking.wales/cy/resource/service-blueprint-template-welsh.png).

## Get involved

All our code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/learnbymakingwales/repositories).
