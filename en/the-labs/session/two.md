# Session two

Session two introduces the team to a service design challenge. It's purposefully abstract so that any organisational constraints can be left at the door and to encourage the team to think about problems in new and different ways.

During the session we'll explore elements of service mapping, identifying users, various research techniques, and how to adapt to unforseen problems.

There is a strong emphasis on having fun!

## The make

The specifics of what will be made during session two will vary. We also don't want to give too much away before the day as there is an element of 'thinking on your feet'!

However, there will be an opporunity for the team to update the website from [session one](/en/the-labs/session/two.html) with what they learnt on the day.

## Learning outcomes

* Starting small and learning as you go
* Care about your users over your product
* The importance of feedback loops
