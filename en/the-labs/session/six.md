# Session six

Session six is all about prototyping. Making a thing that can be put in front of real users. Throughout the session we'll work in 'micro sprints' to help us stay focused on the right things and keep up momentum. The short sprints will also give us an opportunity to get rapid feedback from within the team.

## The make

What is made will depend a lot on the problem that was identified in [previous sessions](/en/the-labs/session/three.html) and the [subsequent designs](/en/the-labs/session/four.html) and [user journeys](/en/the-labs/session/five.html). But we imagine that we'll make use of a [prototyping toolkit](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/lbm-prototype-kit).

## Learning outcomes

* how to get started with a prototyping kit
* how sharing things early can help the team stay focused on the right things  
* the value "done enough" vs "perfect"
