# Session one

 Session one of Dysgu trwy greu has two main objectives.

1. To get to know the team and establish a safe place to experiement and learn
2. Get everyone on the team set up with the tools and resources they'll need

## The make

Each session will involve a "make", or a series of "makes". The make will vary with each session, sometimes it will be a digital thing other times the make might be physical. But regardless of what the make is the goal will be to share these things after each session.

During the first session we'll make:

* a set of team princinples
* everyone's 'manual of me'
* a team website

## Learning outcomes

### The team and users

* The importance of empathy for the team and users
* The importance of being open and honest
* That behaviours matter more than processes

### Tools and resources

* An introduction to [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* How to use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to easily create a website

## Session resources

### Manual of me

Inspired by Emily Webber's [team manual](https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/) and using Cassie Robinson's [template](https://cassierobinson.medium.com/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) we've created our own version of the 'manual of me'.
