# Session three

The focus of session three is to identify what problem we'll be tackling through the remainder of the Learn by making sessions. We'll use a combination of web analytics, prior user feedback, contact centre data, as well as other sources of information to identify problems and help us prioritise what we need to focus on.  

## The make

By the end of session three we'll aim to show an outline of the problem that we'll be working on for the subsequent Learn by making sessions. This may be in the form of a 'one-pager' or similar, and will identify the users, their (assumed) needs, and the evidence that supports the decision to focus on this problem.

## Learning outcomes

* How to uncover and prioritise user needs
* Using data to make decisions
* How to be comfortable with uncertainty
