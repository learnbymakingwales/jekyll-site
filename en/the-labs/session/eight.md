# Session eight

For the first series of Labs, Learn by making this will be our final session. We have two main objectives for session 8.

1. To take the time to reflect as a team. What are the things that worked well and where are there opportunities to make improvements. What did the team learn, and did those learnings match-up to our intended learning outcomes. Whether there is anything from the Labs experience that the team would like to take back to their "day-to-day" working, and if so what support or help do they need. 

2. To playback what the team achieved over the course of Labs to their peers, senior stakeholders and other interested parties.

## Learning outcomes

* running a retrospective within a safe environment
* how to show and tell your story
