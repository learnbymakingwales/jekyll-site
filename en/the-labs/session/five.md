# Session five

The plan for session five is to build on the ideas from the [previous session](/en/the-labs/session/four.html), creating some user flows that demonstrate how the service may work, and to establish a backlog of tasks that need to be completed to build a prototype.

## The make

By the end of the session we'll be able to show:

* some user journey flows
* a prioritised backlog of tasks

## Learning outcomes

* how to identify which parts of a user journey are most suitable for prototyping
* experience co-design and working through a potential solution as a team
* how to build a backlog of tasks that allow everyone in a multi-disciplinary team to contribute
