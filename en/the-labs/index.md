The learn by making digital lab will consist of a set of activities split across 4 themes.

Each lab will be unique to the team taking part and the activities will be chosen to give them a specific, practical and helpful experience making digital products and services. The aim is that all participants will be able to use what they learn in the labs in their own role afterwards.

The activities will be practical, immersive sessions that will help people taking part learn digital skills and make things - in the open, for real.

We have 4 themes which we see as the most important parts of learning by making.

![A poster showing the 4 themes and what participants can expect to learn in each part. The first week is "Introducing agile service design" and participants can expect to learn about building a safe space to learn, making in the open, researching users and their needs and designing products and services. Week 2 is Researching a problem space where participants can expect to learn about prioritising problems to solve, using dats to design services, inclusive design from the start and quick idea generation. Week 3 is Learning by making. Participants can expect to learn about prototyping, co-designing a service, working in sprints and showing as you go. Week 4 is building momentum and participants can expect to learn about testing prototypes with real users, analysing what you are hearing, making the case for change and use working in the open to build momentum.](/assets/images/4-themes-show-and-tell.png)
